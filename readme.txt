This analysis system was developed  5 or 6 years ago. It automatically records daily stock trading information from the Internet (Daily stock trading information is free, but long-term stock trading information is charged). 

From the nearly 4,000 stocks, the five stocks with the best short-term profit and the five stocks with the long-term profit are selected. This analysis software helped me make a little money (mainly from long-term profitable stocks), but I lost it in the end. 

In the future, I have always wanted to develop a better system with the help of deep learning. I firmly believe that I will make money from the stock market.
